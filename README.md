# Logistic-Regression-in-Python
I utilize a dataset pertaining to an airline to construct logistic regression models in Python.

I perform basic logistic regression in Python to on a large dataset pertaining to airline satisfaction.

My modeling procedures explores the relationship between in-flight entertainment & overall satisfaction of customers.

My results seem to indicate that the more entertainment, the happier customers are. 

I also perform relevant statistical tests & create a confusion matrix using training and testing data subsets from my modeling procedures.
